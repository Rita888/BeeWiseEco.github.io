Highly motivated and experienced ecologist with a passion for advancing technology to assist with conservation and sustainable practices. Leveraging over nine years of experience in ecological research and analysis, I have honed a deep understanding of ecosystem dynamics and enhancing biodiversity. Committed to reducing carbon footprint, I proudly own a hybrid vehicle, aligning personal values with professional ethos. Currently, I operate remotely through my own ecological consultancy, offering specialised services to support ecological and biodiversity enhancement and management. Thriving in the dynamic realm of freelancing, I excel in project management, data analysis, and client relations. Equipment used to deliver ecological projects: DJI Air2s Drone, Sony IR camera x2, various bat detectors.
